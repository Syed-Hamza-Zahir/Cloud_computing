# Public Cloud 

• A service provider makes resources, such as virtual machines (VMs), applications or storage, available to the general public over the Internet 

• Public cloud services may be free or offered on a pay-per-usage model 

• The main difference between public and private clouds is that the individual or organization is not responsible for any of the management of a public cloud hosting solution 

• The data is stored in the provider's data center and the provider is responsible for the management and maintenance of the data center

# Private Cloud 

• A private cloud is a cloud computing model that involves a secure cloud based environment where only the specified organization can access its resources 

• Data center may be wholly in-house on the company’s premises, or provided by a third party 

• Private cloud services can vary considerably from a technical aspect, therefore it is usually categorized by the features that they offer to their client

# Hybrid 

• Hybrid cloud is a cloud computing environment which uses a mix of on-premises, private cloud, and third-party, public cloud services with adaptation between the two platforms 

• By allowing loads to move between private and public clouds as computing needs change, the hybrid cloud gives organizations greater flexibility and data deployment options

# Relationship between Local and Cloud Resources 

• The traditional IT model advantages and disadvantages 
  
  - Advantages: Very secure/full control of applications and data 
  
  - Disadvantages: Own Hardware/upgrades, software/upgrades, power/issues, redundancy and business continuity, large in-house IT department 

• Cloud computing model advantages and disadvantages 

  - Advantages: Flexibility and scalability with hardware, software, power issues, redundancy and business continuity are handled by vendor, and smaller IT department 
  
  - Disadvantages: Security might be a primary concern, expertise with application needs

#  Cloud Connectivity Methods 

• Web portal – customer accesses the cloud through a website 

• VPN – customer makes a VPN connection over the Internet to the cloud system 
  
  - Public cloud services may offer VPN appliances or native VPN through the network services control • Direct connection - A more predictable connection might be direct private connection via co-location facilities 
  
  - Referred to as cloud hotels, cloud providers partner with large data center providers 
 
  - Direct connections come in two Ethernet speeds of 1Gbps or 10Gbps 
 
• Telco managed – Individuals or organizations have a wider variety of connectivity with Telco providers 
 
  - Telco providers offer MPLS and Ethernet connection options and a variety of contract lengths

# Security Implications/ Considerations

Cloud Security Implications/Considerations 

• You are not in control of your data 

• The provider must have good controls and assurances in place 

• You will need to implement compensating controls to cover any gaps discovered in the provider’s security e.g. encryption or local copy of the data

• You will be responsible for the security of any aspect of the cloud that you are permitted to configure e.g. health record

# IaaS Security Implications/Considerations 

• Similar to the concerns of a traditional corporate data center 

• You the customer will be responsible for all aspects of security at all levels of your network + firewalls

  - Provider is responsible for security of physical equipment and personnel that maintains the physical equipment 

• You the customer are responsible for ensuring compliance standards are evaluated and met 

• An auditor will need to be able to determine if compliance requirements are met

# PaaS Security Implications/Considerations 

• The provider is responsible for physical equipment and platform/system availability 

• You the customer are responsible for: 
  
  - Any applications you have configured on that platform 
  
  - Monitoring access and usage 
  
  - Keeping track of regulatory compliance 

• One of the features you will have to decide on is whether or not you will include (and pay for) redundancy

# SaaS Security Implications/Considerations 

• The provider is responsible for most of the security 

• You the customer are focused on application configuration and data protection 

• You are also likely to be concerned with maintaining: 
  
  - Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls (e.g., single sign-on and federation) 
  
  - Data protection technology (e.g., data loss prevention and encryption) 

• You might choose to integrate your on-premises deployment with the SaaS deployment
